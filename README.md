# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository explores the process of **requirement analysis** in software development.  
It serves as a foundation for understanding how to gather, document, and manage software requirements effectively.  
You'll find structured insights, examples, and best practices to support planning and communication throughout the software development lifecycle.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of users, stakeholders, and the business are identified, gathered, analyzed, and documented.  
It helps define *what* a system should do rather than *how* it should do it.

This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the system requirements and helps prevent costly misunderstandings or changes later in development. It involves activities such as requirement elicitation, validation, documentation, and management.

### Importance in SDLC:
- Ensures the development team builds the right product.
- Helps in setting clear goals and scope.
- Reduces risk of project failure due to vague or misunderstood requirements.
- Improves communication between stakeholders and developers.
- Provides a baseline for testing and validation.

In short, effective requirement analysis lays the groundwork for a successful software project by aligning the technical solution with user needs and business objectives.
